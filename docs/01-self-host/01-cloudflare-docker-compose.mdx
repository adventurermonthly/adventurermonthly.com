# Foundry SelfHost With Cloudflare & Docker Compose

<img src="/img/guides-img/flying-whales.webp" className="guide-img-600" />

An alternative to port forwarding utilizing cloudflare tunnels and a docker installation on your local machine.

## 1. Setup a Cloudflare Account

If you don't already have one, [sign up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) for one.

## 2. Purchase or Transfer a Domain Name (or don't) 

I belive you can skip this step if you *REALLY* don't want to purchase a domain name.  If you would like to be able to have a custom domain (or more likely a number of subdomains at a custom domain) you can do so in one of the following ways:

### 2.a If You Already Purchased A Domain Elsewhere...

There are a few steps to setup your domain with cloudflare if you purchased it elsewhere.

Before you can set up your tunnel, you will need to [add a site and configure cloudflare domain servers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/).

These are the prereqs you will see in the [tunnel docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/local/#prerequisites).

### 2.b If You Would Like To Just Buy One At Cloudflare ( or not buy one at all)...

You can register a new domain name with [Cloudflare Registrar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/get-started/register-domain/).

You will want to [add a site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/account-setup/add-site/) in either case as I believe it is a required step for the tunnel.


## 3. Setup a new Tunnel

This can be done either through [Cloudflare's WebUI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/) or for those prefering the command line, the Cloudflare CLI.


## 4. Docker Compose
