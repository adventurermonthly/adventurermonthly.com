If you try to run `docker compose up` on  linux and get permission denied, there are two remedies.

1. run `sudo docker compose up` - by default your user is not added to the docker group and cannot start / stop containers.  Running as root remedies this.

2. Add your user to the docker group.  This is easy and there are instructions in Docker's [Linux post-installation steps for Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).
